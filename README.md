# My Personal Project

## About Me

Hi! Iâ€™m Deana, a student passionate about programming and the arts. I have experience in:
- **Python**
- **C**
- **Web Development** (HTML, CSS, a little JavaScript)

Besides coding, I love **reading**, **painting**, and **drawing**. I believe creativity and technology go hand-in-hand, and I often explore ways to combine them.

## Whatâ€™s in this Project?

This repository is a space for me to:
- Share code Iâ€™m working on (Python, C, web apps)
- Display some of my artwork and creative projects
- Document my learning journey and experiments

## Interests

- **Programming:** Exploring new languages and building small tools or websites.
- **Art:** Watercolor, digital art, and sketching.
- **Reading:** Novels, graphic novels, and tech blogs.
